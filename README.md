# Numerical Methods (Python)

This repository contains Python implementations of **core numerical methods** used for solving mathematical and physical problems that do not admit closed-form analytical solutions.

The focus is on **algorithmic clarity, numerical stability, and practical applicability**, with methods commonly encountered in undergraduate and postgraduate physics, mathematics, and engineering curricula.

All programs are fully implemented and tested, producing reliable numerical results along with clear output and visualization where appropriate.
